      <title>Our legal (and moral) system flavors the jerks</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: The author&amp;rsquo;s knowledge about the legal system by no means applies to anywhere outside of his homeland. But what is legal or illegal should be similar enough for the discussion below - at least for first world countries, I guess.
That said, the author is not a lawyer and does not have accurate knowledge of any concrete laws. But one does not need to know (too many of) them for this article.</description>

      <title>Why use binary search when you can guess where it should be</title>

      <description>Why ignore 50% of what we know about the data1 Everyone learnt binary search in Algo 101. It is the fastest way (among comparison based searches) to find an element in a sorted array. All you need to carry out the algorithms is the comparison between the target element and the element at the current position. It is widely applicable because it assumes so little from the data. But for many real life problems, we do often know something apart from merely the comparison between the two numbers.</description>

      <title>Work at the level of abstraction that works for you</title>

      <description>Ladder of abstraction Well the title is obviously a tweak of the &amp;ldquo;ladder of abstraction&amp;rdquo;. For those who does not know, &amp;ldquo;ladder of abstraction&amp;rdquo; refers to the classic essay by Bret Victor. I am kind of stealing this terminilogy for the reader to visualize climbing up and down on the ladder of abstraction to make it easier to explain the nature of different jobs. The main question this blog post deals with is:</description>

      <title>Relaxation is the result of mastery. With thoughts about problem solving</title>

      <description>Relaxation as a result of mastery, instead of a prerequisites In many sports/ crafts that I have experienced, relaxation is considered by many the prerequisites of mastery:
In playing piano, your fingers, wrists, arms and shoulders have to be relax or you will find it extremely hard to press the right keys fluently; In online games that require fast reactions, rookies hands are stiff and they press buttons with unnecessary strength and range of motion, which stops them from pressing right buttons at the right time smoothly; In jiujitsu, being reasonably relax helps you to perform efficient moves, saving your energy and gives you more choices in different situations in which you have to adapt and react quickly.</description>

      <description>Counting binary trees I was thinking about of the problem of balancing a binary tree, and my mind stumbled across to the question &amp;ldquo;How many different binary trees with labelled nodes can you make without changing the traversal order?&amp;rdquo;. After figuring out the answer myself I realized that the numbers of such binary trees are just Catalan numebrs (I was not really into combinatorics - now I am).
For example, the following has traversal order 1-&amp;gt;2-&amp;gt;3-&amp;gt;4-&amp;gt;5-&amp;gt;6-&amp;gt;7</description>

      <title>Why do I hate using chatGPT to replace search engines</title>

      <description>My pc is overheated how do i cool it down because it is my life1 Someone said that chatGPT will replace Google. Some kids/ early teenagers do often ask chatGPT for things that could have been found by Googling.
I really hate the idea of replacing search engines by chatGPT. The problem I have with it is not really about AI, but about how do we interact with it.
When we were kids and learnt how to use search engines, we acquired the skills of capturing important parts of the questions in our minds and turn them into keywords.</description>

      <description>I am Chan Shue Long, you can also call me Jack, which is a made-up name just like many asians do when they assimilate the &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; circles. I use the handle &amp;ldquo;KatsuragiCSL&amp;rdquo; occationally (that&amp;rsquo;s why the Github username and the domain name of this site).
Mathematics is my first love. I am also into computer science, philosophy, chinese literatures and sports. I ended up working in security industry and I also love it - to explore the &amp;ldquo;applied&amp;rdquo; side of things.</description>

      <title>Unity Game Reversing(1): Setup</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blogs/software-hacking/unity-game-reversing-1/</link>

      <description>Introduction Recently I am trying to reverse engineering a simple Windows desktop game made with Unity. I took a look on some reference but found that the setup can be a bit frustrating. This post is attempting to make the setup clearer and more followable. Reference links are listed below.
Tools Our target is to decompile and debug the Assembly-CSharp.dll inside the folder &amp;lt;game root folder&amp;gt;\&amp;lt;GANE_NAME&amp;gt;_Data\Managed\, which contains custom code the game developer wrote, not the code of Unity or other frameworks.</description>

      <description>Introduction LOTS project, founded by mrd0x, is a collection of websites which is likely be trusted but can be used to evade detection when conducting phishing, C&amp;amp;C, exfiltration and downloading tools. In this post I will introduce a way to abusing PayPal and hopefully will be contributing to the LOTS project.
This series is (intentively) for my ideas on novel exfiltration/ C&amp;amp;C channels.
Exfiltraftion by Paypal In Paypal, one can dispute an order and upload his/ her evidence.</description>

      <description>Tl;dr - unfixed information disclosure in Prisma Cloud defenders This post is about how to abuse a agent of a cloud security solution to get information which you should not know, like what security controls are applied, what assets the victim owns and the owners of the assets.
Introduction A few months ago I was examining the Prisma Cloud configuration of my workplace and accidentally discovered an information disclosure issue of Prisma Cloud defender (the agent).</description>
