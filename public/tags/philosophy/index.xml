      <description>Info
Updates:
After giving a second thought on the topic and reorganizing the materials, I had a sharing session with my teammates and decided to update this article accordingly. Updates include more suitable examples and graphics.
Info
Updates 2:
It is revised again and published as a preprint. Now you can see it at https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17813 or https://katsuragicsl.github.io/papers/connectedness/
An empty business lingo or a good quantification? We hope to, and probably need to, quantify the severity of security bugs.</description>

      <title>Our legal (and moral) system flavors the jerks</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blogs/thoughts/our-legal-and-moral-system-flavors-jerks/</link>

      <description>Disclaimer: The author&amp;rsquo;s knowledge about the legal system by no means applies to anywhere outside of his homeland. But what is legal or illegal should be similar enough for the discussion below - at least for first world countries, I guess.
That said, the author is not a lawyer and does not have accurate knowledge of any concrete laws. But one does not need to know (too many of) them for this article.</description>
