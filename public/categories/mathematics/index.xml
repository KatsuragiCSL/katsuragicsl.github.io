      <description>Stone–Čech compactification One of the proof of the Stone–Čech compactification is to consider the continuous functions from a given topological space $X$ to $[0, 1]$.
Crux 1: constructing $[0, 1]^{C}$
Let $C$ be the space of all continuous functions from $X$ to $[0, 1]$, consider $[0, 1]^{C}$, there is a natural map from $X$ to $[0, 1]^{C}$: for each $x \in X$, define $\phi(x) = f \mapsto f(x)$. With product topology $\phi$ is continuous.</description>

      <description>I was going through a problem in Lee&amp;rsquo;s Topological Manifolds book1 (problem 7-12). It states that the infinite broom has a strong deformation retract to $(0, 0)$ but not for $(1, 0)$ (only a deformation retract).
Below is some of my playful observations inspired by this problem. (Not restricted to the infinite broom space.)
Inifinite Broom Note that the deformation retract to $(0, 0)$ itselfs imply the deformation retract to $(1, 0)$, since one can define the deformation retract to $(1, 0)$ by &amp;ldquo;first retract to $(0, 0)$, then push it to the point $(1, 0)$ along the line joining these two points&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Amazed by how ring theory can be linked up to topology</title>

      <description>I am reviewing some fundamental algebra, and I just learnt something beautifully suggesting the connection of ring theory and geometry, which made me eager to learn some algebraic geometry (which I was not very interested when I was in undergrad). It is an exercise in Aluffi&amp;rsquo;s book1.
Lets&amp;rsquo; jump into it.
The problem Let $K$ be a compact topological space, and let $R$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on $K$, with addition and multiplication defined pointwise.</description>

      <title>A more intuitive explanation of Burnside&#39;s lemma</title>

      <description>Warning
You need to know some basic group theory terminology to appreciate(I hope you do) the following content.
Burnside&amp;rsquo;s lemma Here is the statement of the Burnside&amp;rsquo;s lemma:
Let $G$ be a group that actions on a set $X$. Denote $X^{g}$ the set of fixed points of $g$ i.e. $\{x \in X | g \cdot x = x\}$, then the number of orbits of the action is equal to $\dfrac{1}{|G|}\sum\limits_{g \in G} |X^g|$.</description>

      <title>An elementary solution of a weird intergal problem (Putnam 1985 A5)</title>

      <description>Problem Let $I_{m} = \int^{2\pi}_{0} \cos(x)\cos(2x)\dots\cos(mx) dx$. For $m$ in $1, 2, \dots, 10$, for which $m$ is $I_m \neq 0$ ?
Solution $I_m$ is non-zero if and only if $m \equiv 0, 3 \pmod{4}$.
Main idea The official(seemingly? It is in the putnam problem book and a few solutions I found online do the same.) solution is to substitute $\cos x = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}$ followed by grouping the terms into $\cos x \cos (2x) \dots \cos (mx) = e^{\text{something}}$, and analyze the something.</description>

      <description>Counting binary trees I was thinking about of the problem of balancing a binary tree, and my mind stumbled across to the question &amp;ldquo;How many different binary trees with labelled nodes can you make without changing the traversal order?&amp;rdquo;. After figuring out the answer myself I realized that the numbers of such binary trees are just Catalan numebrs (I was not really into combinatorics - now I am).
For example, the following has traversal order 1-&amp;gt;2-&amp;gt;3-&amp;gt;4-&amp;gt;5-&amp;gt;6-&amp;gt;7</description>
