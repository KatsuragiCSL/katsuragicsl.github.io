Once you got struck by the elegance of something, you will be its slave your whole life.

I could not get away from the wonder I got from many beautiful ideas, and will likely keep looking for the same wonder over and over, like a mouse in a conditioning experiment. This blog attempt to record my thoughts and let those wonder out by writing them down. \
...with occationally some miscellaneous things: pretentious "tutorial" series (that never finish), personally thoughts about a bit vulgar matters.

My name is Chan Shue Long, you can also call me Jack. I use the handle "KatsuragiCSL" on the internet occationally (that's why the Github username).
