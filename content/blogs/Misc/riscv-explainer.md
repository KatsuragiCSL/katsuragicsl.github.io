I happen to have to learn (just a bit of) RISC-V assembly, so I made a simple risc-v instructions explainer so that I don't have to do multiple google searches whenever I have troubles in reading some risc-v instructions.

It can fully run in the browser, feel free to try it out at https://katsuragicsl.github.io/riscv-explainer/.
