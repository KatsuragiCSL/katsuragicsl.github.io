> This is somewhat a sequel of the previous post [about the game played between the jerks and the normal people]({{< ref "/blogs/thoughts/our-legal-and-moral-system-flavors-jerks/" >}} "jump to the post"). This post is closely related since the exploitation of asymmetry of opportunity cost is a generalization of the issues we discussed in the previous post. However this post focuses more on conflicts resolution, not necessarily related to ethics.
> The order of sections in this post does not follow a strict waterfall model. It is not like a story telling or trying to prove some points by gradually elaborating it. It consists of a few thoughts that I had related to the same topic, hence some sections might look like standalone.

### Time is an universal equalizer, but some people have a more equal equalizer

People say "Time is an universal equalizer, everyone has exactly 24 hours a day". Indeed, everyone has equal amount of time (let's put the factor of lifespan aside), but some people's time is more equal - in the sense that, a unit of time can cost differently to different people, due to the asymmetry of opportunity cost. 

Let's start with a special case example: time pressure in negotiation. We all know that if you are in a negotiation and you are in a hurry to get the deal closed (perhaps your boss promised to fire you if you fail, or in an apocalyptic world you are negotiating with the only person who has the medicine to save you and your wife who are seriously ill) and your opponents knows it, they can take advantage of it.
