We hope to, and probably need to, quantify the severity of security bugs. The &amp;ldquo;need&amp;rdquo; mainly come from that we have to provide an interface to management: we need to have a reasonably objective quantification to tell how serious an issue is (and show that we would not overplay/downplay something for our own self-interest), and that lay the ground of the establishment of a bug handling standard that the engineering team would follow.</description></item><item><title>Unity Game Reversing(1): Setup</title><link>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/security/unity-game-reversing-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 04:16:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/security/unity-game-reversing-1/</guid><description>Introduction Recently I am trying to reverse engineering a simple Windows desktop game made with Unity.
