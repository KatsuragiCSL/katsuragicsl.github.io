Poincaré first conjectured that any $n$-manifolds homologous (i.e. having the same homology) to the $n$-sphere should be homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere, then later he found a counterexample, which led him to a modified conjecture (which is the Poincaré&amp;rsquo;s conjecture).
The counterexample he found is very interesting, one of the way to construct it is the folowing:</description></item></channel></rss>
