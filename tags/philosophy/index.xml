Updates:
After giving a second thought on the topic and reorganizing the materials, I had a sharing session with my teammates and decided to update this article accordingly. Updates include more suitable examples and graphics.
Info
Updates 2:
It is revised again and published as a preprint. Now you can see it at https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17813 or https://katsuragicsl.github.io/papers/connectedness/

But what is legal or illegal should be similar enough for the discussion below - at least for first world countries, I guess.
That said, the author is not a lawyer and does not have accurate knowledge of any concrete laws. But one does not need to know (too many of) them for this article.</description></item></channel></rss>
