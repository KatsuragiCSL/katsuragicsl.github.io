They totally missed the points and these behaviors made them look like slaves of their very own defense mechanism1.
Deepseek did make some techonological breakthroughs. Indeed the censorship is a defect of such a great product.</description></item><item><title>Why do I hate using chatGPT to replace search engines</title><link>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/thoughts/why-do-i-hate-chatgpt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 23:39:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/thoughts/why-do-i-hate-chatgpt/</guid><description>My pc is overheated how do i cool it down because it is my life1 Someone said that chatGPT will replace Google. Some kids/ early teenagers do often ask chatGPT for things that could have been found by Googling.
I really hate the idea of replacing search engines by chatGPT. The problem I have with it is not really about AI, but about how do we interact with it.
When we were kids and learnt how to use search engines, we acquired the skills of capturing important parts of the questions in our minds and turn them into keywords.</description></item></channel></rss>
