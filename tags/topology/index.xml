Crux 1: constructing $[0, 1]^{C}$
Let $C$ be the space of all continuous functions from $X$ to $[0, 1]$, consider $[0, 1]^{C}$, there is a natural map from $X$ to $[0, 1]^{C}$: for each $x \in X$, define $\phi(x) = f \mapsto f(x)$. With product topology $\phi$ is continuous.</description></item><item><title>Playful observations with deformation retracts and path connected-ness</title><link>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/mathematics/playful-observations-with-deformation-retracts-and-path-connected-ness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 01:47:45 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/mathematics/playful-observations-with-deformation-retracts-and-path-connected-ness/</guid><description>I was going through a problem in Lee&amp;rsquo;s Topological Manifolds book1 (problem 7-12). It states that the infinite broom has a strong deformation retract to $(0, 0)$ but not for $(1, 0)$ (only a deformation retract).
Below is some of my playful observations inspired by this problem. (Not restricted to the infinite broom space.)
Inifinite Broom Note that the deformation retract to $(0, 0)$ itselfs imply the deformation retract to $(1, 0)$, since one can define the deformation retract to $(1, 0)$ by &amp;ldquo;first retract to $(0, 0)$, then push it to the point $(1, 0)$ along the line joining these two points&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>From casual description of Turing Machine to the density of uncomputable functions</title><link>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/computer-science/from-casual-description-of-turing-machine-to-uncompuatble-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 01:23:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/computer-science/from-casual-description-of-turing-machine-to-uncompuatble-functions/</guid><description>Defining the machine by describing it In Sipser&amp;rsquo;s Introduction to the theory of computation, a alternative way of defining a Turing machine (other than defining the formal 7-tuple, which is a PITA) - by its &amp;ldquo;description&amp;rdquo;.
