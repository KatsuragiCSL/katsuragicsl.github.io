The true talent is the ability to carry on with passion, even when it probably won&amp;rsquo;t pay off.
(not translated word by word)
I was a teenager and it did not make any sense to me. How could passion be the true talent? Look at those geniuses like Gauss, Mozart, John von Neumann! What they have done is not something that could have been done by normal people.</description></item><item><title>Relaxation is the result of mastery.

In playing piano, your fingers, wrists, arms and shoulders have to be relax or you will find it extremely hard to press the right keys fluently; In online games that require fast reactions, rookies hands are stiff and they press buttons with unnecessary strength and range of motion, which stops them from pressing right buttons at the right time smoothly; In jiujitsu, being reasonably relax helps you to perform efficient moves, saving your energy and gives you more choices in different situations in which you have to adapt and react quickly.</description></item><item><title>Why do I hate using chatGPT to replace search engines</title><link>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/thoughts/why-do-i-hate-chatgpt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 23:39:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://katsuragicsl.github.io/blogs/thoughts/why-do-i-hate-chatgpt/</guid><description>My pc is overheated how do i cool it down because it is my life1 Someone said that chatGPT will replace Google. Some kids/ early teenagers do often ask chatGPT for things that could have been found by Googling.
I really hate the idea of replacing search engines by chatGPT. The problem I have with it is not really about AI, but about how do we interact with it.
When we were kids and learnt how to use search engines, we acquired the skills of capturing important parts of the questions in our minds and turn them into keywords.</description></item></channel></rss>
